# Fluff

- when an accomplishment falls below an expected performance level, this is considered fluff
- ambiguous action will impact the overall scoer much more than an ambiguous result

e.g.

- **Incredible leader**; **essential to PERSCO team**--250 Airmen deployed to AOR
	- incredible leader does not describe performance
	- essential is intangible and does not describe impact

- **Vital member of team**; processed 2K orders--**sustained AOR mission**
