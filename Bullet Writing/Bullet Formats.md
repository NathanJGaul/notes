# Bullet Formats

- two or three part bullets
	- both are suitable for communicating accomplishments

## Two Part Bullet

- Accomplishment-Impact (AI) Format

### Accomplishment Element

 - describes the behavior or action of the individual
	 - **exactly what they did**

### Impact Element

- characterizes the result of the behavior
- gives scope and serves as the connective tissue between the action and the result
- the connection strength will be explained through the TOS concept

## Three Part Bullet

- Action-Impact-Result

### Action Element

- clearly describe the individual's specific contribution
- defin the "level" of performance
	- did the member perform a task, or was the action performed at a higher level

### Impact Element

- explains how the individual's performance influsenced the next level and provides scope or influence
- serves to connect the action and the result
	- the stronger the connection the stronger the bullet

### Result Element

- qualifies the outcome of the individual's efforts
- establishes the contribution's value

## Examples

### Example 1

- 2 Part: Changed aircraft tire in 1 hour; repair returned aircraft fully mission capable
- 3 Part: Changed aircraft tire; repaired in 1 hour--aircraft fully mission capable
- Sentence: Changed aircraft tire in 1 hour returning the aircraft to fully mission capable

## Reverse Format

### Example in 3 Part Format

- Rewrote technical data; corrected assembly errors--avoided minor wear

### Example in Reverse Format

- Avoided $20M damage! Rewrote technical data; correcteed safety errors

- result moved to the begining because it was the most significant part of the bullet
- do not bury information, engineer bullets to help reader clearly see the important parts
