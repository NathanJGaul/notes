# Positioning Your Bullets

> In general, put a leadership bullet with far-reaching impact in the most important “top and bottom” lines of your report. Work your way down from there to the member/follower bullet impacts. Hopefully, you will have most, or all, of the space filled up with higher level effects and not have to use the low impact lines at all.
