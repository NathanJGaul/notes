Performance Levels include...
- leadership
- management
- supervisory
- membership

a nonperformance bullet is called "fluff"
you need to document (and perform) above your position grade

## Membership

- tactical-level activities on a small scale
	- job performance in your primary duty includes helping, assisting, participating, and supporting
	- self-improvement describes short training courses, college classes, example like the College-Level Examination Program--things that would be considered the building blocks toward more significant educational accomplishments
	- base and community involvement includes helping, assisting, participating, and supporting
	- mentoring includes your impact on the people in your charge
