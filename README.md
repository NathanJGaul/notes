# notes
This repo contains my personal knowledge base, a place where I can extract, express and store my personal knowledge.

## Structure and Organization

 - each note is self contained in a single markdown file (mapped to a page after compilation)
 - notes should contain a single subject and broken out into subtopics (tree) if applicable
